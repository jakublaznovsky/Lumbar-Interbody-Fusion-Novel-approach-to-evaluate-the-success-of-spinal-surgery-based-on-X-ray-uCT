##Abstract
Many novel biomaterials are recently investigated for use in spinal fu-sion surgery, especially in lumbar interbody fusion. The X-ray microCT as a tool is widely used for evaluating how successfully those biomaterials can perform a vertebral fusion. However, the current methodologies of microCT image assess-ment are based on visual evaluation by the operator. In this paper, we propose a methodology for how such biomaterials can be investigated in pre-clinical studies by investigating fused vertebrae morphology. We utilized microCT scans of pigsâ€™ fused vertebrae to develop a fully automatic approach, which can characterize the morphometry of the bone in the fused region. A surface mesh model was created to extract the newly formed bone tissue between fused vertebrae in the microCT data. Extracted bone tissue was consequently evaluated according to the selected morphometric parameters. Characterization of the newly formed bone properties in the intervertebral area can be utilized to evaluate the osteogenesis function of implants used in lumbar interbody fusion surgery.
